C# .NET 4.5 Port of the iota lib (https://github.com/iotaledger/), build to fit into Clean Architecture (see below).

## Motivation

The project was set up a little different from most iota libs, since Clean Architecture enables you to follow the SOLID principles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) pretty easy.

## Note

The project is still in development. Therefore breaking changes may occur.
You can reach me via iota slack (@felandil) if you've got any questions.
